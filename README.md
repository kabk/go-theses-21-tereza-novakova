# UNdesigning the Self

### Narrator’s prologue

My name is Tereza,
there is no information hidden in this sentence.

If I take into account Carl Jung’s theory about Persona, I could say that my Self is composed of four layers.

My name is Tereza,
speaking plainly, I want to tell you a story about the last layer of my psyche called Anima/Animus.

Anima/Animus stands as the base of all one’s actions, it represents the deepest unconsciousness, basic impulses, general instincts which govern one’s behavior. It is not easy to observe.

My name is Tereza,
let me guide you through my personal Catharsis on the topic of Selflessness. Please notice, being Selfless in this thesis doesn’t necessarily mean caring for others with no expectations, but the narration of one’s empty Self.

Now you might be asking, why did I become interested in losing my Self? I sincerely felt the urge to turmoil and the selfish pursuit of pleasure so deeply. Please, don’t mistake me for someone who would like to escape nor someone who hates one’s Self. This observation is more about the purification of one’s nature, analysis of the possible Selflessness in 21st century society, and an interest in the ethics of animals which is hidden in all of us.

My name is Tereza,
correct me if I’m wrong: one is one’s Design. Living in the Era of shared information, Era of multi-social media, one now can (re)-form, (re)-shape, (re)-design, altogether adjust one’s Self; one tries to fit within the parameters of current society.

This Catharsis has materiliazed into a Magazine full of observations, experiments, short stories, definitions, research, thoughts of others, interviews, and analysis.

My name is Tereza,
I like the idea that we are all created from the mother earth, I’m one and one is me, as well as one is anything else on this planet. The influence is mutual. It might be a common fluid state of being that leads us to these thoughts, it might be our own humanly narcissism.

With what animal one will identify when removes one’s Ego? I want to find out what would happen to one when one would be able to enter one’s inner world. In fact, I’m curious to meet my Animus/Anima, curious to reach the moment of Nothingness in me.

My name is Tereza,
I’ve constructed The Egoless manifesto, I’m trying to live within the rules, it seems a difficult task. I’m investigating if one’s Nothingness could achieve its Fullness.

According to Jung, the Pleroma is the totality of all opposites. In Christianity, it means to fill up an empty thing or to complete an incomplete thing, else the state of fulness or completion, the fulfilment, the full amount. Is it possible to design one’s own personal subjective Pleroma?

My name is Tereza,
I know I’m repeating myself, however, this is the last time I’m saying it to you. From this moment on, I will try to act as an Egoless person.

Now you might be asking, what did I find?
My name is…  
that’s enough for now!

![1.0 THE THESIS STRUCTURE](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/8,9.png?raw=true)

# Anotation

In my work, I deal with the identity of the Self and its position in society. We can perceive this connection either from a subjective or objective perspective. There exists a self in the real world and another in the online reversed world, which enriches but also disrupts our perception.

Nowadays, we have time and space to deal with the form of ourselves; we live in a realm where we feel pressured to design our identity in order to survive, hence we articulate ourselves through short extracts from reality. The concept of self-design is elemental to my thesis.

I base this study on a desire to express myself more genuinely and present a more real version of myself in the world; I was only able to do this via the removal of my narcissistic Ego. The primitive effort to find a balance in simple animal beings, through which I try to seek answers, was my means to me undesigning my Self.

However, I have come to the conclusion that in order to find positive harmony, one needs to find harmony through the whole, which includes the Self and its surroundings. Through my investigation, I have found that the search for Self-harmony is to be an inclusive one, otherwise, it merely becomes the destruction of culture. The search for inclusive harmony leads to knowledge and understanding.

# I, as a selfless human. *'To what extent can one express the subjectivity objectively?'*

## Selfishness
Since I value honesty I would like to start with a notification: this is not an academic paper. Enduring this abstract purging was for me a personal path. Even though I tried to be very objective, I cannot help but be highly subjective. It is paradoxical that in the course of study aimed at the suppression of my Self I’ve discovered I more retain a narcissistic perspective. One’s Self is an appliance to express individual inner entity, vice versa a subjective outer society is a consequence of our mutual affect.

Achievement of the harmony in the collective interest would mean completeness of a whole. The draft of this idea of experiment occurred to me a few years ago, back then I was daydreaming about my own disappearance for a year, about formulation of a new identity that I would never reveal to anyone. In general, I was fascinated by how much the society in which we live designs who we are. The core of the old idea is by some means similar to my thesis experiment, in both one has to re-form the Self, however, in this case, the attempts took just a few minutes and within my current surroundings.

The Manifesto is something that came completely spontaneously at the outset of my experimentation to behave according to the Animus, I had to set the rules of my analysis, to be able to practice it within my own restrictions. The experiment actually developed into a form of literary output, that feels like the most natural way to express the abstraction of my findings. To be able to truly achieve the desired catharsis I had to first think in my mother language Czech, therefore I have decided to keep both language versions. I wonder if my personal approach could be at least partly universal.
## Living statue
Experiment(1): 1. 10. 2020 Stokabar

Nothing is futile, nothing is the useless,
deprived of inspiration, I’m only what was left in me,
since to live, so solely dryly, without the one’s flow,
standing up simply by command, without oneself and without everything.

Only me and again me, in the extreme presence,
on Thursday morning I listen to your rage,
I’m just my bare self, and I know, the trees are furious,
after all, in the chilly morning, the pretty dew is falling,
that amount of the leaves, that are about to sleep, in the day as well as in the night,
likewise to my own inner awakening.

I didn’t ask anything, entirely paying attention,
I pour the required rum and one small 10.7,
and he said that twenty years ago, he played the accordion here,
first, he had mistaken the decade and I smiled,
I can still smile, right?

Am I becoming a living statue or just a tool of patience?
My manifesto is my portal to the cruel existence.

Dismissed from my own irons,
bravely with emptiness,
in vain listening to what he collected last week,
I’m finding out about his dead wife, who gave him to his fiftieth birthday,
a new phone number, with three sixes at the end, and enduing her with three fours.

Then that unwanted moment came,
when he asked me a simple question,
“Are u still studying?”
and I just agreed I guess what else I would want,
nourished by silence and austere sentences,
kicking myself under the table with my own foot,
however fruitlessly dragged by one’s own decision.

And so there then together with my nothingness,
we stand at attention, I heard all of it,
we grow into silence together, in that silence I act as a traitor,
listener without the tongue, I answer plainly,
clearly, shortly.

Everything is devastated, everything is rejection.
One could say that a bad day assaulted me,
that I’m just hiding from the world.
Simply only I know that I’m scantly a robot,
performing the tasks assigned to me,
without my Self, I had become the nodding.

Nonetheless, this is not what I wanted,
that the existence has been replaced by body language,
for that reason, I’m writing to you here and now,
that even that nothingness is heavier
than my empty Self.
## Manifesto
That’s why I repeat my manifesto:

I understand and accept all my mistakes,
the ones I did, and the ones that await me.
All my decisions are influenced
only by my current environment,
everything that is happening right now is everything, that is supposed to be.

I’m not a nihilist, I’m not a cynic,
I’m for myself my own design,
I’m the simple front of my inner emptiness.
Deprived of my identity, I’m driven by pure being.
A machine that does not know human values.

No matter how much I know,
because always someone else will know more.
I will never become better than others,
never evolving into enough good person.
Yet I’m aware that at the same time,
I’m NOT worse than others,
so that’s why I won’t ever be a bad person.

The only certainty is death and the constant of change,
the change ongoing right now on this planet.
Me as a metaphor for acceptance,
greeting changes of all kinds,
I’m NOT trying to convince, persuade,
or reassure and encourage.

My only authorities are knowledge with cognition,
which I accepted by my Animus.
I have no need to judge anyone,
I won’t have any urge to know what others are like,
likewise, I don’t care what others are trying to tell me.

In short,
at the bottom of my Self,
there somewhere lies around,
that sincere acceptance of oneself
like a stranger in my body.

This is an unpleasant perspective,
to see inside what is hiding from me.

![1.3 THE CATHARSIS OF SELF IN 3D](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/16.png?raw=true)

When I finished the previous page my heart totally ached. At the beginning, one can see that participation in the experiment seems impossible, too many thoughts kept me to feel like a living statue, although experiment(1) was one of my first attempts I was hardly able to stay Self-free. It almost seems like a procedure, one has to train it, develop an approach to study the inner Animus. A few times I had to interrupt and accept it as a trial. To have some kind of consistency I determined it as a narrated progress of the analysis of one’s traits, of the deeply animalistic features, the ones I cannot get rid of.

If we omit the fact that we have ourselves, we will be left with only our Selves, for this reason its particular narration is quite essential. Dutch graphic designer Mieke Gerritzen in his book Help your Self defined the Self as your ‘personality, motivation, emotional intelligence, self-confidence, fears, habits, cravings, possibilities, lifestyles, sense of humour, political choice, hobbies, and life skills, talents, experiences, values, capacity for empathy, negative thoughts, ability, desires, expectations, self-awareness practice, risk tolerance, and mistakes.’ [2] I want to take into account whether one is even able to give up all of this. What will happen when this all disappears?

By releasing a strong emotion at the time of writing, as well as purging the mind of unwanted thoughts, my thesis refers rather to some kind of catharsis or
emotional leak. To behave without Self-concern, the ego has to go through a cathartic cleansing or to be completely replaced by a new ego that lost its old Self.
## I am not
Experiment(2): 1. 10. 2020 Evening of the POETIC dekadence

I grew up without any suppression and oppression,
I became a slug, I am only the food of birds,
always unprotected from the outer wily world,
exposed to an external environment,
no longer just a girl.

I crawl stupidly, without hands and without knees,
that suffering is educational,
I make sticky paths behind me that can’t be straight,
because after every inch I forget the way back,
they’re just confused, upset, thus they agree,
they throw a hateful look back,
God, which way did they let you take?

I’m dragging that sticky shiny line, I call it nostalgia,
from time to time I appear somewhere, where I can feel like a beast,
that I almost forget I’m just the slug,
with feelings of inadequacy, impossibility, captured by a bird of prey.

Barely breathing, suffocating, but still being, I’m feeling myself with all my senses,
even though I’m just a fictional delusion, a state of your mind,
directed by my desired hypnotic states
of non-existent celebrated reality.
Offered nothingness, beloved manifesto,
my personal removed feelings.

Here lies a moth, somewhere in a dusty corner,
the small one, altogether half-dead, nude curls herself,
nothing and the emptiness that frees her,
renounces her life, when you tell her about a confused world,
she is swallowed by panic, by darkness.

A chilly second, that long is the moment
of purification, repentance, and humility to the beloved moth,
however, she is a nocturnal animal, gripping tightly
her wings sifted by departure, that liberating couple.

Without yourself, you moth unknown, you will become forgotten,
however, the misunderstood moth filled with her decision,
strongly longing for an even colder spring of your forgiveness,
those cramps of that terrible night,
the moth is getting sick, the happy creature.

Squeezing her body, she has poor nightmares,
not manageable,
full of anger, corruption, the other side of your goodness that always shines,
it is politics, as a result of the elections, she has this lousy picture of herself,
she breathes and loses the remnants of her self, throwing it into the unknown.
My role was played, I’m no longer a moth
or my shadow,
in the old days of the relatively compassionate,
I was just a lap,
but now in the clear light, bearing no limit,
I am a non-existent cliff,
I’m a drop of rain, I’m just a mistake,
I’m here and I’m not here right away.

It’s an automat, definitely xenophobia,
my impulsivity or a broken mind.
When anxiety meets relaxation, you scream fiction,
an infinitely accurate loop is created,
yet quite unrelated, still a little girl.

A sincere flourish a grow in a Zen garden,
arbitrarily afraid that it is going unintentionally smoothly.

I am your beetle, fully alive, holding my breath, I feel like inside of my body,
I’m slowly drying out what I was for me.

Fallen, yet supple petals,
lying on the moss of your cleansing kisses,
I was dried, although a lady who was becoming juicier,
discovered memory of a beetle in a casket, furthermore I was just lying.

I think, with my head placed in my palms,
the head is heavy from the lateral stages of thoughts,
what furiously radiates that joyful awakening.
I am pleased to say
that a new Self has been found, a new connection,
effortlessly, without my Self,
renouncing life, I am looking for a new awakening.

Pure energy, namely the suspension,
I’m no longer a flower,
having a lost Self, I’m just an animal,
aI’m just my Animus, what was left inside of me,
I love you all the shapes of my animal Selves,
what did you not like?
You enjoy the world, don’t you?


As a result, I only have this lousy picture,
and so the slug, moth or beetle,
I don’t feel anything, I’m nothing, I don’t exist,
I’m just a loose whiff that you breathe,
I’m an air of I can’t get a single dose,
I’m the rain that fell on your face last Tuesday,
in short, I am not.
## Half-female, half-animal
Those days when I was taking part in The Experiment(2) I felt empty, I found myself in situations when I just couldn’t bear anything else other than the fight with my Animus. With my friends I had organized an Evening of the Poetic Dekadence, not only to share one’s poetry but to rejoice in the written word before the pandemic times start to influence our social life again. Even though I didn’t feel like performing, I shared my findings. It took place in my room in Prague where I’ve stayed during my internship. There has been built a throne for reciters, elevated armchair that was decorated in Decameron style, with a lot of fresh and healthy-looking fruit on a little drapery hanging down.

This scenery led me to my memory of old gothic manuscripts from the 13-14th century with margins filled with absurd situations such as the fight against the snail. One cannot exactly know what it actually meant to be, for me its form, as well as the subject matter, somewhat in a loose way merges a closure of chapter one.

Two anatomically and culturally defined characters. The wisdom of nature endows a creature with natural armour, while a human had to get to the point in the evolution when one had a knowledge of how to make the armour and adopt it. Both armours are used as protection against the outer world. Both creatures are consciously aware of the fact that they could be in danger. It might be just a cartoon or a single sample of medieval humour. In the first serious contemporary study of this odd phenomenon, Lillian Randall wrote, ‘Perhaps the joke is that snails, what with the shells they carry on their backs and can hide away in, are some sort of parody of a highly-armoured chivalric foe. We’re supposed to laugh at the idea of a knight being afraid of attacking such a ‘heavily armoured’ opponent. Silly knight, it’s just a snail!’ [4]

The fight constitutes an idea of the inner confrontation with one’s natural traits or something that the society has established. Thus it’s quite polemic to say who is stronger, it appears like the knight is losing or at least cowering in terror. They are both aware of the advantage of having natural armour. To such a degree I deal with my own Slug, recognition of its strongnes/weakness guides me to separate features into categories.

# We are never alone with our Selves. *'Hi Jung, how did I meet your Pleroma?'*

## One
T: You felt the urgency to break down the Persona into components, forget the view of the individual, and gain the general focus. How did it all begin?

J: ‘About 3.5 billion years ago life has originated in the form of primordial, relatively simple organisms.’ [7] On the grounds of modern science, we believe all living things have evolved from this inferior unity. Charles Robert Darwin was the first who ‘accumulated evidence showing that evolution had occurred,’ [5] he claims that diverse organisms such as humans, animals, and plants ‘share common ancestors.’ Nevertheless, he was influenced by the thoughts of René Descartes, who declared that ‘a rigid distinction between human beings and “others” lies in de-automatization Self-acting.’ [6]

T: In other words, the animals cannot articulate thoughts to one other, they have a different kind of soul, purely mechanistic in essence. However, I’m one and one is me, I sense the presence of an animal inside.

J: As the civilization evolved in specific species with determined presumptions, one also went through the progression of one’s Self. Personas as identities, make us different from animals, humans acquire various kinds of them, however, animals have only one identity, unchanging.
![2.0 ARISTOTELIAN GRADATION OF THE SOUL](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/26.png?raw=true)
## Wholeness
T: If one wants to be freed of something, one has to identify what to get rid of. In your book Aion - Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self, you declared if anyone wants to achieve ‘the complexity of cognition, not only intellectually, but also according to its feeling-value, must for better or worst come to grips with the Anima/Animus problem in order to open the way for a high union of opposites.’ [8]

J: Yes, ‘this is an indispensable prerequisite for wholeness! The process of Individuation lies in Psyche’s Self-regulating system, by maintaining a balance between opposing qualities while constantly striving for growth.’ [8] The Mind is a fully conscious perception fixed by Psyche, in which its components function rather like secondary Selves altogether contributing to the whole.

T: So the term wholeness is equivalent to the Self?

J: Wholeness results from Self consciousness. We are continually generating more material to integrate into Psyche, which makes it difficult to achieve any balance. ‘At first sight, wholeness seemed to be nothing but an abstract idea, it is nevertheless empirical in so far as it is anticipated by the psyche in the form of spontaneous or autonomous symbols.’ [8]

The concept of the psyche is broken down as follows:
![2.1 JUNG’S MODEL OF THE PSYCHE](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/27.png?raw=true)
## Significances
T: I’m particularly interested in how the 4 significances..persona, ego, shadows and animus, are connected.

J: ‘They are indicators with their own vertical order, their hierarchy represents “higher” and “lower” self, their arrangement designs a central signifier below the personality. Significants that gives us the ability to look ahead and seek fulfilment together.’ [8]

T: Selfish behaviour is in general perceived as something egoistic or narcissistic. Does Selflessness stand for Self-sacrifice?

J: The essence of Self lies beyond the subjective realm. ‘To say that someone is Self-centered is to say that they are precisely not egotistical and narcissistic, but rather philosophical, having a wide perspective and not personally reactive or easily thrown off balance.’ [10] ‘Selflessness is rather transcendent deprivation,’ [8] which means beyond or above the range of the psychic realm.

T: The Ego is the center of one’s consciousness, you write it ‘perceives meaning and assesses value.’ [8] Is awareness a result of the consciousness of Ego?

J: ‘The “I” feels naively, that has existed forever.’ [10] Being concerned with Self-awareness, obviously, the Self has the highest position, however mutual with the Ego. I believe in ‘a privileged, intimate relation between those two components, therein the Self is in fact an image of the Ego, a kind of Super-Ego or ideal of the Ego.’ [10] The Ego as an organizer of our thoughts, feelings, sensations, is the one who can access our memory.

T: Why are you using the term Persona, when its origin comes from the mask worn by Greek actors?

J: In Greek philosophy, Persona means ‘the packaging of the ego’, like that it works in one’s Self, as ‘an adaptation or personal convenience.’ [8] One might say that one’s social success ‘depends on having a reasonable well-functioning persona, on being flexible enough to adapt to different situations, on the accuracy of the ego expressions that lie behind it.’ [9]

T: According to your construct, is it right to assume that Shadows are the opposite of Persona?

J: Indeed, the Shadow carries ‘all the things we do not want to know about ourselves or do not like, it is the opposite of those traits of which we are conscious.’ [9] ‘Not only that the shadows provide depth to our personalities, but also bring us into a broader understanding of the identity.’  [8]

T: You write about a door, that may be an entrance to animal cognition, which remains in humans as a result of evolution. The door?

J: ‘The Anima/Animus are subjective personalities that represent a deeper level of the unconscious than the shadow. They exist but cannot but cannot be observed directly. For better or worse, they reveal the features of the soul and lead into the realm accessing the images of the collective unconscious.’ [10]

T: What is the difference between Anima and Animus? Describe in detail why you conceived Anima/Animus as a ‘contrasexual archetype’?

J: Individuation differs for the opposite sex, beginning with mother and father. Conventionally, for men the anima is a feminine figure; for women, the equivalent inner figure called the animus that is masculine.’ [8]

T: I understand you are influenced by the gender-based thinking of your time, however, I find this part quite controversial, and I cannot identify myself with this gender-oriented study, so forth I will be using just the word Animus for the rest of my Thesis, and I omit the masculine and feminine aspects.
## Pleroma
![2.2THE PATH OF PLEROMA](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/30.png?raw=true)
T: You describe the theory about Nothingness in relation to Fullness in your book Seven Sermons to the Dead; it seems to be absolutely essential for my observation, can you explain it?

J: ‘I begin with nothingness. Nothingness is the same as Fullness. In infinity full is no better than empty. Nothingness is both empty and full. A thing that is infinite and eternal hath no qualities, since it hath all qualities.’ [11]

T: ‘The state of total Fullness or abundance is related particularly to the nature of God, representing the Fullness of the divine being.’ [12] Does it mean that by pure being we are Pleroma itself?

J: ‘The totality of all opposites emerges in Pleroma, completed incomplete being. We are the Pleroma itself, but we are also not it, since we are distinguished from the pleroma in our essence as creatura, which is confined within time and space.’ [11]

T: It is the beginning and the end of one’s existence, what lies between is insignificant. Could then one look for Pleroma through Individualisation?


# Ego-death. *'How have the Selfless literary practices been changing the cognition of human essence?'*
Subjective analysis of three novels representing the course of one’s Psyche. I have decided to take into account three factors, the differences between the Selves of the main characters, the consequences of their approaches, and possible Self-narration.

## Principles
The Man Without Qualities [a] plainly observes life within his absolute principles [b], he experiences rather the factual matters of external circumstances than a decisive generalization [c]. He perceives anything individually instead of the collision of things and affairs [d] since reality is just a trivial rhythm for him. [e]

[a] Main character of the book The Man Without Qualities vol I. Sort of Introduction and Pseudo Reality Prevails written by Robert Musil in 1930
[b] We are confronted with the enigma of who we are, but The No Q Man seems to have an answer to all sorts of subjects due to his Egolessness, he redefines the certain realness, improving, thus enriching it with his orderly perception.
[c] He allows the society to shape his Self and through that he comments its nature. Musil does not just pursue the quality of The no Q Man’s Persona, moreover, the influence of human qualities constituting certain subjective environments.
[d] Therefore his actions means something else to others, he is portrayed as a spectator without any specific intention.  
[e] As if the fluid recording evokes our nothingness, assuming it’s the reason we are unable to feel the harmony of the Self versus society.
## Acceptance
As life is just passing by, Meursault [f], passes together within it, in his essence an assertive calm man, a nihilistic spectator [g]. His directness seems frustrating because of his inability to feel emotions let alone portray them to others [h], consequently his radicality puts him in questionable situations that are not socially acceptable [i].

[f] Main character of the book The Stranger written by Albert Camus in 1942
[g] His approach to Selflessness essentially differs from The No Q Man, life affairs occur unintentionally but do not obtain any principles.
[h] The worthlessness of life symbolizes the fullness of its exhaustion, by reaching the totality through plain being, Camus interprets an existential Pleroma.
[i] Meursault persists as a dry commentary of society, the simplicity of his conviction stops him from evolution, so he will never be able to accept any cognition. Significant is that he does not want to.
## Automatization
Well known Gregor Samsa [j] went through metamorphic-like transformation into an insect [k], supplementary his visual change grows into deprivation of the ability to act as a human [l]. His metamorphosis appears as a simulation in order to come back to the natural order of life, that’s why his reaction seems immediate, understated, and surprisingly rational [m]. Finally by accepting the futility of his Self, he rather dies. [n]

[j] Main character of the book Metamorphosis written by Franz Kafka’s in 1915
[k] The animal does not decide whether to change or not. It is not acting of its own free will. It’s an instinct. And there is a big difference, with human metamorphosis which is more likely caused by mental state of one’s Psyche.
[l] Gregor loses his identity not because he is an insect, but because he loses ability to fulfil his social role.
[m] The metamorphoses of animals are mechanical, automated, conditioned by physiological and developmental process.
[n] Truthfully Selfless character, wanting to be just accepted by his family, after change it’s impossible to achieve their appreciation, Gregor’s Self loses its meaning.
## Together
“IF one wants to pass through open doors easily, one must bear mind that they have a solid frame: this principle, according to which the old professor had always lived, is simply a requirement of the sense of reality. But if there is such a thing as a sense of reality—and no one will doubt that it has its raison d’être—then there must also be something that one can call a sense of possibility.”…”So the sense of possibility might be defined outright as the capacity to think how everything could ‘just as easily’ be, and to attach no more importance to what is than to what is not.”…“It is the reality that awakens possibilities, but who will first give the new possibilities their meaning and their destiny.”[13]

“Then he asked me if I wasn’t interested in a change of life. I said that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another and that I wasn’t dissatisfied with mine here at all. He looked upset and told me that I never gave him a straight answer, that I had no ambition, and that that was disastrous in business”[14]

“However, Gregor had become much calmer. All right, people did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because had gotten used to them” [15]

# Narcissism and social media. *'In what way does online voyeurism change the perception of our Selves?'*
## Narrated
![4.2 Natrration of online self permeates to one’s persona](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/41.png?raw=true)
## Next story
Living in 21st-century in post-informative multi-media times, we are becoming the narrators of our Online-Selves. Current technologies along their metaphorical personalities are built and subsequently shaped by us, on that, we are being retroactively formed back, endlessly reflecting each other. With no surprise the technology affects us as if it had a complex of inadequacies, we chrome its self-confidence and evoke the beauty in the user.
-> next

The network does not absorb one’s identity and it does not want to, either. On the contrary, it bears this idea to deepen our relationship with our own Personas, in a way it flies around to expand us, it changes the general perception of the human existence, yet still, it fascinates us by ordinary things such as a lover’s sight or hater’s parade. We are witnessing the new perception to experience things, while we remain motionlessly in the remembrance. It connects our Selves and morphs them together, its environment unites in one whole.
-> next

I want to emphasize the idea that multi-media is neither an enemy to us nor a substitute for our real lives, it is a new influx. The current world that we find ourselves in, at this extreme presence, will take into itself the new ongoing influx as the past took into itself the plagues, revolutions, studies, and delusions. Certainly, we are at the point where there is no going back.
-> next

Accordingly to our positions, we become narcissistic creatures living in the virtual world, we articulate ourselves through short extracts from reality. We leave our mark on social-media as the caveman would express himself on the wall of his cave. To pass it further. Nevertheless, there is a huge difference between those two examples, our statements are awfully public, the messages to the empty space appear differently depending on how attentive our readers are. How much they can perceive or appreciate the shared information.
-> next

‘The narcissism is understood as a total concentration on oneself, as a lack of interest in society. But neither is he interested in an “inner,” “subjective” vision accessible exclusively to his own contemplation, isolating him from others. Rather, he is enchanted by the reflection of his body in the lake presenting itself as an “objective,” profane image—produced by Nature and potentially accessible to everyone.’ [16]
-> next

It depends on the author if the focus does not miss the aim. Self-sharing that we provide to each other is a metaphor for the virtual interpretation of one’s Persona. Today we have space, platforms for everyone to present those big Egos without restrictions and limitations. In order to be able to feed those narcissistic Selves, we need to achieve the specific coexistence in a necessary principally distinct extent.
-> next

Anthropologist Kathleen Richardson states that enacted proxies of our real selves through two key concepts: ‘Co-presence, (the act of physically being a presence in another person’s company), and reputation (the estimation and perception that others have of a person).’ [17]
-> next

Multi-media has provided one with the means to [re]make, [re]define, [re]present oneself online. Consequently, the problematic moment arises within the consciousness of one’s online Egos. The online Self ethics seem to differ from our real world ethics. Suddenly the world appears to us only how we would love to maintain it, and this causes pain, despair, and hope. The absolute presence of every day, us who put out of countenance each other, the invasion of constant information, suddenly we are looking for the natural way of human desire for a fuller feeling of life and finding its meaning.

What is the Online-self trying to accomplish by generating the dream to be admired behind every corner? Aiming for thousands of likes and infinitive views, by producing material that no one can remember.

![4.5 RECOGNITION OF OTHER SELVES](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/46.png?raw=true)

What is the Online-self trying to accomplish by copying the patches of others, hence setting the trends? The speed of spreading the information is so fast, the first resistance to unusualities turns into an affected assumption in a second. Dominating stupidity and its repetition cause unconventional thus blind support.

What is the Online-self trying to accomplish by pretending the comprehension of unfamiliar matters?
One sits wherever around the world by the small or big screen, as the one used to sit in the backyard, bordered by a fence and possibilities. The only thing that has generally changed is the amount of received information.

What is the Online-self trying to accomplish by daily following others’ life achievements?
The quantity, that arouses desires in one, makes one possessive, jealous, anxious, as a consequence of daily feed one allows emotional disturbance, blocks one’s own growth.

![4.6 MUTTUAL AFFECT OF THE SELVES](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/47.png?raw=true)

What is the Online-self trying to accomplish by depriving the privacy of other’s personas including one’s own? The animus is the only part of our personas that remain uncontaminated. By extracting one’s narcissistic Egos back, one could for once act as a spectator, not as an actor.

Therefore, I think it would be wrong to say that Narcissus is uninterested in others, in society. And so one assumes that others will be also fascinated by one’s own worldly image. ‘The contemporary Narcissus, however, cannot be so certain of their own taste.’ [16]

‘Today we are unable to like ourselves if we are not liked by the society in which we live.’ [16] And in our society we have to become active if we want to be the objects of others’ admiration. Kathleen also declares that in order to achieve public admiration, one must practice Self-design and its demonstration.
## The new voyeurism
Constant Online attention grows in a load of enduring structureless fragments, by carrying messages about ourselves to others, we become indispensable, self-centered, and egoistic.

As a narcissistic society that is able to acknowledge quite a specific image of a unified whole, we are “forced” to take an interest in multi-media. In turn, it generates a universal narcissistic fascination with Voyeurism. ‘Voyeurism has traditionally meant the pleasure of secretly crossing the borders of a foreign territory, looking through a slit into the secret of another. However, in today’s Information era, Voyeurism is becoming an accepted universal standard.’ [18]

Voyeurism alleviates the weight of perception on the self, that brings us safe pleasure - we need to see but mainly to be seen, we find delight in online comparisons. ‘What is unique about digital narcissism is not the mechanism of narcissism itself, but a kind of megaphone effect with increased opportunities for pursuing narcissistic goals, if not also a competitive pressure to be seen and heard in a vast ocean of social media noise.’[19]

Thus the unknown has lost its delightful scent, its pheromones or musk. The unknown was completely revealed, the new Voyeurism set a new trend of known unknown. Vaclaj Hajek states in his essay Orgies of narcissism, self, super-face, visual self-righteous, ‘it is more interesting for us to focus on facts on self-reflection, self-esteem and self-presentation…The previously hidden unknown stands before us in its nudity and at the same time frightening, which no longer attracts or seduces us.’ [18]

# Talking as a compulsive simulation. *'What does the acknowledgment of one’s Animus mean for social communication?'*

## Emptiness
If we take into account the term Pleroma, the narcissism represents the fullness, then rationally the nihilism represents the nothingness, on the grounds that nihilist believes in nothing and that nothing can be known or communicated.

When one will get deprived of his Ego, talking suddenly seems like a compulsive simulation, ‘the amount of information will be eliminated due to the need to act only on the basis of primitivity.’ [23] Language is understood as a learned extension of communication, it is transmitted culturally, it is taught, corrected enlarged vocabulary.

The mind will be waiting for content that will be eventually filled in, and this creative perspective instils power in the emptiness. So forth everything that surrounds one at that moment, is just a reaction of the stated simulation. One has to be really good at authenticating oneself to accept his assertiveness and embrace the complete refusal. In the article ‘When will I be me? Why a sense of authenticity takes its time’, written by Elizabeth Set argues that authenticity simply means embracing who you really are, at your very core, and acting in accordance with your own values and beliefs. In other words, authenticity is a subjective judgment.

Nothingness as a non-action, a symbol of non-being, ‘yet emptiness doesn’t mean “nothingness” or “energy-less… rather in many cases, the emptiness indicated a condition, which will likely be filled with content in the future.’ [21] To embrace emptiness, one has to leave an empty place in the center of the Self. ‘The mechanism of communication is activated when we look at an empty vessel’ [25], ‘not as a negative state, but in terms of its capability to be filled with something.’ [21] Emptiness, the same as being deprived of one’s Ego does not merely imply the simplicity of one’s persona. ‘Rather, emptiness provides a space within which our imaginations can run free, vastly enriching our powers of perception and our mutual comprehension. Emptiness is this potential.’ [21]
## The society doom
When nothing is said, the communication stops being a meaningful linguistic exchange of some sort, yet there are times when words and content are unnecessary. In detail the successful communication does not start and end with a mere exchange of signs, thus when this exchanging process is performed simultaneously, an instant and mutual understanding occurs. Emptiness carries our thinking process forward.

The mental activities of one’s Animus do not begin at ground zero, rather, they are expressed as an unconscious impulse to survive, an emptiness that sets the brain to work and maintain the simple gut. ‘The fact that humankind has a history in the sense that animals do not is entirely the result
of language.’ [20]

Immediately when we turn ourselves to the invisibility of our own subject, we become Self-sufficient in ourselves, when we overcome the paradoxical Self-objectification, we expose our inner sincere animus. This act then ceases to be Meaningless. One tries to get the ideal status of his hyper-real empty human Ego, entity. So the moment of lost Self is connected with the loss of memory, we are literally forced to give up our experiences and the mental image of our own past. Without talking, we would lead the society to its doom.

WHEN YOU BREED, YOU WANT NOTHING - BUT YOU WANT SOMETHING. YOU WANT SOMETHING WHILE YOU WANT NOTHING. YOU DESIRE FOR NOTHING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOUR DESIRE. YOU DESIRE A DESIRE THAT MAKES YOU DESIRE SOMETHING.
Leo Tolstoi

# Existence becomes design. *'Does one even need to seek one’s own distinctive identity?'*

## Privacy
One’s positioning in society determines the well-being of the whole, the mutual performance grows into an overall legible image of the current human evolution, which, as the first generation, we are able to observe live. Thanks to technology, in the last 30 years the perception of information exponentially developed, together with it the general cultivation of our personas. Hypothetically everybody is a designer nowadays since society requires it, after all, one has to design one’s Self to present it in order to survive. ‘The ultimate problem of design concerns not how I design the world outside, but how I design myself - or, rather, how I deal with the way in which the world designs me.’ [26]

Multi-media constantly pressures us to imitate the perfect live life, by taking care not only of our appearance, but also our inner Self. The Dutch graphic designer Mieke Gerritzen states that society shaped a new phenomenon in the Self-help industry. ‘The media provides us with an image of an existence in which we are rich, beautiful, happy and successful to be. We know product design, interior design, graphic design, interaction design and fashion design. And now there is also self-design.‘ [26] Authentication became a trend, most of the humans who harvest their Self publicly think their sincere authentication is an artwork, it’s a task that craves research, reflections, analysis, realizations, observations, and actions. In my opinion, one needs the deprivation of all the influxes, at least those that are pointing towards a very specific direction, to truly evolve into convincing original. To be saved from our Selves we have to not be ourselves. It seeks one’s responsibility towards the world to call for the de-globalization to be different.

Self-transparency is a very questionable topic, Mieke writes about a need to form a new defence mechanism that is a reaction to the flood of images that comes from the Outer world, ‘our bodies, with the old genetic transmission, have not kept pace with the new language-produced cultural transmission of technology. So now, when social control breaks down, we must expect to see pathological destruction.’ [28] To some extent this means playing 21st-century hide and seek with each other - against privacy, the right to be free, control over our data, and systematically taken decisions. Does even one have still something to hide? ‘Existence becomes design. Who you have become is based on a combination of circumstances that you have combined with your own choices… Privacy is an unpopular problem of our time.’ [26]

## Primitive automatization
The culture that we live in is characterized by its mobility and connection. We unite as a clan of social creatures, herd together as sheep or ants. We have to remember we are still the biological species, well-behaved animals, just with the most intricate network of systems. Not robots yet, nevertheless living in the reversed world in which we are voluntarily exchanging our privacy for comfort. To get it back one has to give up online existence, which means no smartphone, no apps, no online banking, no fb events, nothing. Seeking for identity offline, designing the private space where one has to identify as anything else than just a person. 	

Considering the possibility to function as an offline-designer, who gave up all the desirable Personas, I can imagine one would gain one’s authenticity. We can say that we are all aware of the fact that the democratization of technologic has made possible to resume or remix somebody else’s work, however, society hides it from itself, dealing with ordinariness is just a never-ending curve, we are walking on the moving path that is exponentially leading upwards. In general copying, same as automatization is perceived as something negative, non-creative. Mieke writes that ‘creation apparently requires influence.’ The digital empire of online art completes itself in a database for satisfaction our current information needs, from adding your own inspiration to creating united growth, because every idea is a connection in itself.

Re-designing our Selves is the best way to shape the new phenomenon of Self-help. Same as re-organizing our lives about something else than the systems, although systems bring us plenty, ‘they feed us, keep us warm, safe and healthy - humans can do it easily to become a prisoner of one’s own organizational capacity.’ [29] Stop for a while, think your action through, don’t rush with your decisions, remember that you are not a robot or part of any robotic evil structure, facilitate your existence. This all is not about the controlling, it’s the opposite of it, it’s a purification.

One feels a desire to experience oneself as a part of a larger cultural whole. The desire to know both oneself and one’s environment, then the identity is an imaginary distillate of cognition of both. Therefore, if we’d not experience any authentication or would not recognize any identity in ourselves, we would simply surrender to a pure being and become primitive animals. Personas as an identities, makes us differ from animals.

# Creature Self-design. *'How the state of individual and society depend on each other?'*

## Self-cultivation
The Self has two pedestals to stand on, one representing the Self-cultivation, and the other one representing the social responsibility of Self. We have to stand somewhere between Self-design and being Self-designed by society, striving to find a balance. I believe there are 3 stages in this process.

![5.0 SELF SUFFICENCY](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/62.png?raw=true)
## Conclussion
1
By placing emphasis on a harmonical connection one can achieve a Positive self-design. The lack of one of those design influxes can cause trauma of the displacement Self.

2
In the case of deprivation of Self-cultivation, one is not able to function in life fully, as I haven’t been able to communicate with my surroundings, I let the surroundings utterly affect me. On these terms, society fills in what one loses and automatically forms the needed stabilization, the entire process of castration of one’s own design is being supported by the online existence of our era. In some means, one provides the personal subjective space for the signification of objective society design.

3
If one is not losing anything of oneself then one is also achieving a certain positive existence. Nevertheless, when social responsibilities are negligible, one’s Self lacks a flow of commitment in society, furthermore one just deteriorates or completely dominates the surroundings. A strong personality fills society with itself.

The new Self-perception is adopted as one’s own, except the Animus which stays as the single component unaffected. This procedure is a never-ending struggle to balance autonomy and connection with others. It felt difficult to accept the fact that by accepting the qualitative aspect of intellect as an exceptional advantage of humans, one cannot naturally undergo a metamorphosis into an animal. Instead, one can feel a constant stream of affects, emotional explosions between intellectual deductions.

Losing one’s Self - in other words impersonating - the process of undesigning means depriving one of the Persona, that is significant to play one’s social role. Hence Undesigning one’s Self is autonomous freedom of choice, but by that one will never achieve positive harmony. Impersonating is an act through which we come back to our body, which behaves animally, physiologically, or mechanically in all aspects. This makes one part of the animal world again. This thesis is hopeful finalization of my narcissism.

# What kind of animal are you? *'What did I find due to my incapability?'*

## Circle of my animuses
![6.0 THE CIRCLE OF MY ANIMUS(ES)](https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-21-tereza-novakova/blob/img/65.png?raw=true)
### Moth
Able to orientate itself transversely in space only at the bright night, even tho the moon which reflects the light of day is just a dot above it, even tho the celestial glow is only a distant map. Thanks to it, I sit in places where awareness seems clearer.

The gloom of adulthood, the desire to understand and acknowledge are what the night glow offers to my Moth. I’ve found a piece of Moth in me. The one that allowed me to experience my first metamorphosis, seeing I was born as a larva that didn’t know for so long when it will change, that its significance would soon disappear. It longed to sew a cocoon and spun the knowledge, it was hardworking, learning, fooling around during the day, then for several years, it desired the time when it would become a butterfly that would unconsciously chase after the light, whether natural or artificial. The Moth was the animus of my youth, it’s my maturing. That’s why it represents for me an awareness of the essence of childhood. Still, as the larva it spun a silk cocoon by herself, it was developing itself for silk, as well as the threads that represent its dress. When it reached the phase of the pupa, the transformation from immature to mature followed, its pupae in a dug hole in the ground is a moment of enlightenment for me, it was ready to sense living in flight. After the conversion a sharp fall, the reality of the larva is naive and at some point ridiculous, at that certain moment it felt for the first time a constructed and purifying thought. It joyfully immersed into the deepest darkness, where one can find only oblivion, where it became only a disoriented insect. Then at dusk, its black hair stood on its shoulders, the receptors that picked up the signal of departure, out love for the understanding it has decomposed into the dust, which was blown away by the fast wind. The grime of the Moth of my own newness which is no longer here for me.


### Badger
Performing activities, it likes to walk on the well-trodden paths, it usually walks with periodic and spatial regularity, but be careful not under all given circumstances. In bad weather, it prefers not to go anywhere at all, alternatively, it often changes its direction without consequences in uncanny way, it takes its forever to leave its lair, it looks around here and there.

Automation that is based on obstinacy, scheduling, and simple settlement. The badger is my second animal, my Animus that executes, assures, that is careful of its body. That clearly thinks twice and decides purely rationally. It often shuffles nervously around its lair, so once it has no trajectories, it succumbs to the previous ones. On the other hand, when it returns home, it goes quite slowly, calmly. Thanks to you, badger, I’ve been passively lying in bed all days, I don’t bother to finish my sentences, my actions acquire mechanical precision. Yet, sometimes it stabs me I won’t see the world! You pant for breath with every effort, you try to squeeze where you shouldn’t for no explicit reason, and you even stomp all the time, you stomp outside, you stomp at home, spinning in the circle, you nap in the sun. Ye, in the sun, however only in front of your lair. There you lie then on your back or roll in the dust and sand, you don’t even mind the snow. You move quite minimally accordingly to surrounding objects, for your orientation you only use the hair and after each action, you like to shake off. You want to shake off everything you have collected beyond. I like that like a moth, you love to go out at late dusk, but on the contrary, on moonlit nights you reveal yourself less, you can’t sleep, you are an adult. You also have no problem accepting challenges, although you live in a badger world, still, you can surprise with your roughness, you are not shy, and you look twice as big when you bristle up the hair on your back. For you it doesn’t mean death, it’s just Self-defense, a reaction to the danger of the world of other animals.

### Eagle
It’s under way against the ground, it likes to fly in the opposite direction than the earth is spinning. Its sharp elbows can always be recognized from a distance, it frequently whistles so softly, but in fact, it’s so quiet. It doesn’t like to hang around one place, it needs to pay attention to the environment in which its located. It takes pleasure in watching the human swarming around beneath, it’s openly a voyeur.

You are my greatest narcissist, a symbol of strength and courage, you, my Animus, termed Eagle. Everywhere you look, you find your own floating attractiveness, self-confidence, as well as almost sexual impatience. You are clearly more straightforward than my Moth, or more adventurous than my Badger. You quickly and cautiously take off from the cliffs, concurrently feeling the flow of your own blood, but in my own heart chambers. Especially when you spread your wings, when you cover up to two meters of my own Self, you seem quite pathetic compared to your size. Maybe that’s why you’re quite happy to be alone. At my age I lost friends because of you, some of them died and others could not cross the road, and you watched it all from the mountainous areas. Wherewith your so quiet, weak, high pitched, and so damn, piercing voice, you weren’t able to tell me anything during it. You are an illusion to me, an idealization, you are my icon of dreams and your ambitious goals, however, you moult little by little, from the front to your back, remember. You know very well that you need 6-8 deep strikes to fly, thereafter the rest in form of 2-3 seconds of gliding. I’m looking forward to the winter season when we sleep together, whereas we spend the summer alone. Yet in separation you hunt twice a day for me, you hold our territories, you browse the scenery with your eagle eye, you are my guarantee of longevity. I know you’ll be here for a long time, even tho you’re a partial migrant, you keep your areas. When anyone sees you return in a wavy flight with exaggerated dips, it freezes one and your feathers on the neck straighten up, with your beak open you intensely stare your eyes, you’re here, I know!

### Slug
Barely able to see the outlines and shadows of others, it follows those who have already crawled here, awakens, and tastes what lies ahead. It’s being nothing, it’s often delirious and gets lost in its being.

Deafness and blindness are equivalents of an inability to determine a goal. You are my own mindlessness, the flatness of my confusion, the mere slug I found at the bottom of my Animuses. A long time is not a farce for you. It occurs to me if you find in someone what you have in you, for hours just getting hands-on experience with known, for hours you’re just sniffing around, for hours finding the same slime. You fall in love rashly, you don’t care if it’s him or her, even tho you know that the fight might come. One of you stabs the other with its defensive arrow of thoughtlessness. You call it the love dart. You turn my stomach, or rather I should say all my internal organs upside down. You don’t want to become a mother in fact neither the father. Simply you just exchange what you already have, you are a form of insignificance. Intensively being immersed in snacks, exaggerating inexplicably, you lack importance. You are neither diurnal nor nocturnal, you always show up naked, in perpetuum in wet weather, on meadows, in fields, on facades, anywhere. You are boldly old and unhappy, just because you are covered in the wrinkles of your obscenity, you have no idea how much I don’t want you unless you love, your life will flash by, unless I love you, my life will flash by even faster.

### Empty beetle
It likes to go to the land of the plains, to the sea, and to redeem itself. It has no ambition, the violence disgusts it, it lets itself be carried away by flatness and peace, the world is like a meadow without flowers for it, it doesn’t let itself to be guided by a general urge, it does not look into each of the flowers, the surface of its mind slides, like the easiest gestures of attention.

Although I absorb all perceptions, the formal ones as well as the hidden, unwelcomed ones. I’m not able to remember what prompted me to live so parched, I’m not able to recall my own past, not even my eye color, much as my own beliefs, or which of the toes I have the longest, perhaps even my personal opinion of myself. I’m your empty shell, you, the Animus of the dry beetle. You’re a mental blankness to me, impartially absorbing the outside hustle, then reflecting it in yourself, although probably in a moment of danger, you still feel quite overwhelmed by the desire to preserve our own organism, the thing that holds the body and the mind together. At that moment, I am struck by the feeling of life-sustaining happiness, that I and my body insist on life. You are my sentimentality and disinterest to it, touchingly impartial actions, ordinary gestures, frontside and frontside, indistinguishable faces and moments. What is this moment in time for me? Life poses pass by in a shape of a curve, endlessly I survive the same day, trapped in its dreaming, trapped in your torso, I’m rejecting the perceptions of curiosity, lust, requests, and my own desires. I can’t deny that the taste of reconciliation has always been pleasant to you and that now and here you don’t feel a certain extension of your era, life is not measured in its length, but also not in its volume, I enjoy formlessness or signs of eternity. But I am not part of your landscape, I am just an observer, and for you, both land and sea, are not and will not be your home.

### A-conclussion
Analyzing emptiness is more pleasant than experiencing it, I am not myself, nor an animal or any of my Animuses. Because when my Self thinks only of mySelf, nothing happens. Therefore, all I have left is an explanation, quite unplanned conclusion. Perhaps I am a river that flows constantly around the rocks, perhaps I am a fish in it, which enjoyes the softness of the sand, that is carried by the water itself, perhaps I am a bare foot that has impudently entered that exact environment. Either way, I feel, I know that I am an essence, whether alive or not, I am a reflection in the surface into which you unknowingly stare at, the same flat surface, that is my own no-answer. Dead sure I’m my own design.

## So this is me
