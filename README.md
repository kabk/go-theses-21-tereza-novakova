# UNdesigning the Self

### Narrator’s prologue

My name is Tereza,
there is no information hidden in this sentence.

If I take into account Carl Jung’s theory about Persona, I could say that my Self is composed of four layers.

My name is Tereza,
speaking plainly, I want to tell you a story about the last layer of my psyche called Anima/Animus.

Anima/Animus stands as the base of all one’s actions, it represents the deepest unconsciousness, basic impulses, general instincts which govern one’s behavior. It is not easy to observe.

My name is Tereza,
let me guide you through my personal Cathatrsis on the topic of Selflessness. Please notice, being Selfless in this thesis doesn’t necessarily mean caring for others with no expectations, but the narration of one’s empty Self.

Now you might be asking, why did I become interested in losing my Self? I sincerely felt the urge to turmoil and the selfish pursuit of pleasure so deeply. Please, don’t mistake me for someone who would like to escape nor someone who hates one’s Self. This observation is more about the purification of one’s nature, analysis of the possible Selflessness in 21st century society, and an interest in the ethics of animals which is hidden in all of us.

My name is Tereza,
correct me if I’m wrong: one is one’s Design. Living in the Era of shared information, Era of multi-social media, one now can (re)-form, (re)-shape, (re)-design, altogether adjust one’s Self; one tries to fit within the parameters of current society.

This Catharsis has materialized into a Magazine full of observations, experiments, short stories, definitions, research, thoughts of others, interviews, and analysis.

My name is Tereza,
I like the idea that we are all created from the mother earth, I’m one and one is me, as well as one is anything else on this planet. The influence is mutual. It might be a common fluid state of being that leads us to these thoughts, it might be our own humanly narcissism.

With what animal one will identify when removes one’s Ego? I want to find out what would happen to one when one would be able to enter one’s inner world. In fact, I’m curious to meet my Animus/Anima, curious to reach the moment of Nothingness in me.

My name is Tereza,
I’ve constructed The Egoless manifesto, I’m trying to live within the rules, it seems a difficult task. I’m investigating if one’s Nothingness could achieve its Fullness.

According to Jung, the Pleroma is the totality of all opposites. In Christianity, it means to fill up an empty thing or to complete an incomplete thing, else the state of fulness or completion, the fulfillment, the full amount. Is it possible to design one’s own personal subjective Pleroma?

My name is Tereza,
I know I’m repeating myself, however, this is the last time I’m saying it to you. From this moment on, I will try to act as an Egoless person.

Now you might be asking, what did I find?
My name is…  
that’s enough for now!

# Anotation

In my work, I deal with the identity of the Self and its position in society. We can perceive this connection either from a subjective or objective perspective. There exists a self in the real world and another in the online reversed world, which enriches but also disrupts our perception.

Nowadays, we have time and space to deal with the form of ourselves; we live in a realm where we feel pressured to design our identity in order to survive, hence we articulate ourselves through short extracts from reality. The concept of self-design is elemental to my thesis.

I base this study on a desire to express myself more genuinely and present a more real version of myself in the world; I was only able to do this via the removal of my narcissistic Ego. The primitive effort to find a balance in simple animal beings, through which I try to seek answers, was my means to me undesigning my Self.

However, I have come to the conclusion that in order to find positive harmony, one needs to find harmony through the whole, which includes the Self and its surroundings. Through my investigation, I have found that the search for Self-harmony is to be an inclusive one, otherwise, it merely becomes the destruction of culture. The search for inclusive harmony leads to knowledge and understanding.

# I, as a selfless human.
*'To what extent can one express the subjectivity objectively?'*

Since I value honesty I would like to start with a notification: this is not an academic paper. Enduring this abstract purging was for me a personal path. Even though I tried to be very objective, I cannot help but be highly subjective. It is paradoxical that in the course of study aimed at the suppression of my Self I’ve discovered I more retain a narcissistic perspective. One’s Self is an appliance to express individual inner entity, vice versa a subjective outer society is a consequence of our mutual affect.

Achievement of the harmony in the collective interest would mean completeness of a whole. The draft of this idea of experiment occurred to me a few years ago, back then I was daydreaming about my own disappearance for a year, about formulation of a new identity that I would never reveal to anyone. In general, I was fascinated by how much the society in which we live designs who we are. The core of the old idea is by some means similar to my thesis experiment, in both one has to re-form the Self, however, in this case, the attempts took just a few minutes and within my current surroundings.

The Manifesto is something that came completely spontaneously at the outset of my experimentation to behave according to the Animus, I had to set the rules of my analysis, to be able to practice it within my own restrictions. The experiment actually developed into a form of literary output, that feels like the most natural way to express the abstraction of my findings. To be able to truly achieve the desired catharsis I had to first think in my mother language Czech, therefore I have decided to keep both language versions. I wonder if my personal approach could be at least partly universal.
