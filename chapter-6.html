<div class="move">
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">One’s positioning in society determines the well-being of the whole, the mutual performance grows into an overall legible image &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of the current human evolution, which, as&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the first generation, we are able to observe live. Thanks to technology,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in the last 30 years the perception of information exponentially developed, together with it the general cultivation&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of our personas. Hypothetically everybody is a designer nowadays&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;since society requires it, after all, one has to design one’s Self&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to present it in order to survive.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i> ‘The ultimate problem of design concerns not how I design the world outside, but how I design myself - or, rather, how I deal with the way in which the world designs me.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-23">[ 23 ]</a> </p>
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">Multi-media constantly pressures us&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to imitate the perfect live life, by taking care not only of our appearance,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;but also our inner Self. The Dutch graphic designer Mieke Gerritzen states that society shaped a new phenomenon in the Self-help industry. <i> ‘The media provides us&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with an image of an existence in which&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; we are rich, beautiful,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;happy and successful to be. We know product design, interior design, graphic design, interaction design and fashion design. And now there is also self-design.‘</i> <a href="sources.html#source-23">[ 23 ]</a> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Authentication became a trend, most of the humans &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; who harvest their Self publicly think their sincere authentication is an artwork, it’s a task that craves research, reflections, analysis, realizations, observations, and actions. In my opinion, one needs the deprivation&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of all the influxes, at least those that are pointing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;towards a very specific direction, to truly evolve into convincing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;original. To be saved from our Selves&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;we have to not be ourselves. It seeks one’s responsibility towards the world to call for the de-globalization to be different.</p>
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">Self-transparency&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is a very questionable topic, Mieke writes about a need to form&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a new defence mechanism that is a reaction to the flood of images that comes from the Outer world,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>‘our bodies, with the old genetic transmission, have not kept pace&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with the new language-produced cultural transmission of technology. So now, when social control breaks down, we must expect to see pathological destruction.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-24">[ 24 ]</a> To some extent&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this means playing 21st-century&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hide and seek with each other - against privacy,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the right to be free, control over our data, and systematically taken decisions.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Does even one have still something to hide?&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>‘Existence becomes design. Who you have become is based on a combination of circumstances that you have combined with your own choices… Privacy is an unpopular problem of our time.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-23">[ 23 ]</a></p>

<h2 class="title" id="primitive">6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMITIVE AUTOMATIZATION</h2>
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">The culture that we live in&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is characterized by its mobility and connection. We unite as a clan of social creatures,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;herd together as sheep or ants. We have to remember we are still the biological species,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;well-behaved animals, just with the most intricate network of systems. Not robots yet,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;nevertheless living in the reversed world&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in which we are voluntarily exchanging our privacy for comfort. To get it back one has to give up online existence,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;which means no smartphone, no apps, no online banking, no fb events, nothing. Seeking for identity offline,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;designing the private space&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;where one has to identify as anything else than just a person.</p>
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">Considering the possibility to function&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;as an offline-designer, who gave up&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;all the desirable Personas, I can imagine one would gain one’s authenticity. We can say that&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;we are all aware of the fact that the democratization of technologic&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;has made possible&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to resume or remix somebody else’s work, however, society hides it from itself,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;dealing with ordinariness is just a never-ending curve, we are walking&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on the moving path that is exponentially leading upwards. In general copying, same as automatization&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is perceived as something negative, non-creative. Mieke writes that <i>‘creation apparently requires influence.’</i> The digital empire&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of online art completes itself&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in a database&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for satisfaction our current information needs,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;from adding your own inspiration&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to creating united growth, because every idea is a connection in itself.</p>
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">Re-designing our Selves is the best way to shape&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the new phenomenon of Self-help. Same as re-organizing our lives&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;about something else than the systems, although systems bring us plenty,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>‘they feed us, keep us warm, safe and healthy -&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;humans can do it easily to become a prisoner of one’s own organizational capacity.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-25">[ 25 ]</a> Stop for a while, think your action through,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;don’t rush with your decisions, remember&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;that you are not a robot&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or part of any robotic evil structure,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;facilitate your existence. This all is not about the controlling, it’s the opposite of it,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it’s a purification.</p>
<p class="blur" onclick="myFunction()">One feels a desire to experience oneself&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;as a part of a larger cultural whole. The desire&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to know&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;both oneself and one’s environment, then the identity is an imaginary&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;distillate of cognition of both. Therefore,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if we’d not experience any authentication or would not recognize&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;any identity in ourselves,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;we would simply surrender to a pure being&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and become primitive animals. Personas as an identities, makes us differ from animals.</p>
