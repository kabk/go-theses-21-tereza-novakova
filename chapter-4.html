<div id="slider">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p14>Living in 21st-century in post-informative multi-media times, we are becoming the narrators of our Online-Selves. Current technologies along their metaphorical personalities are built and subsequently shaped by us, on that, we are being retroactively formed back, endlessly reflecting each other. With no surprise the technology affects us as if it had a complex of inadequacies, we chrome its self-confidence and evoke the beauty in the user.</p14>
</li>
    <li>
    <p14>The network does not absorb one’s identity and it does not want to, either. On the contrary, it bears this idea to deepen our relationship with our own Personas, in a way it flies around to expand us, it changes the general perception of the human existence, yet still, it fascinates us by ordinary things such as a lover’s sight or hater’s parade. We are witnessing the new perception to experience things, while we remain motionlessly in the remembrance. It connects our Selves and morphs them together, its environment unites in one whole.
</p14>
</li>
    <li>
      <p14>I want to emphasize the idea that multi-media is neither an enemy to us nor a substitute for our real lives, it is a new influx. The current world that we find ourselves in, at this extreme presence, will take into itself the new ongoing influx as the past took into itself the plagues, revolutions, studies, and delusions. Certainly, we are at the point where there is no going back.
  </p14>
</li>
<li>
  <p14>Accordingly to our positions, we become narcissistic creatures living in the virtual world, we articulate ourselves through short extracts from reality. We leave our mark on social-media as the caveman would express himself on the wall of his cave. To pass it further. Nevertheless, there is a huge difference between those two examples, our statements are awfully public, the messages to the empty space appear differently depending on how attentive our readers are. How much they can perceive or appreciate the shared information.
</p14>
</li>
<li>
  <p14><i>‘The narcissism is understood as a total concentration on oneself, as a lack of interest in society. But neither is he interested in an “inner,” “subjective” vision accessible exclusively to his own contemplation, isolating him from others. Rather, he is enchanted by the reflection of his body in the lake presenting itself as an “objective,” profane image—produced by Nature and potentially accessible to everyone.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-14">[ 14 ]</a></p14>
</li>
<li>
  <p14>It depends on the author if the focus does not miss the aim. Self-sharing that we provide to each other is a metaphor for the virtual interpretation of one’s Persona. Today we have space, platforms for everyone to present those big Egos without restrictions and limitations. In order to be able to feed those narcissistic Selves, we need to achieve the specific coexistence in a necessary principally distinct extent.
  </p14>
</li>
<li>
  <p14>Anthropologist Kathleen Richardson states that enacted proxies of our real selves through two key concepts: <i>‘Co-presence, (the act of physically being a presence in another person’s company), and reputation (the estimation and perception that others have of a person).’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-15">[ 15 ]</a>
</p14>
</li>
<li>
  <p14>Multi-media has provided one with the means to [re]make, [re]define, [re]present oneself online. Consequently, the problematic moment arises within the consciousness of one’s online Egos. The online Self ethics seem to differ from our real world ethics. Suddenly the world appears to us only how we would love to maintain it, and this causes pain, despair, and hope. The absolute presence of every day, us who put out of countenance each other, the invasion of constant information, suddenly we are looking for the natural way of human desire for a fuller feeling of life and finding its meaning.

  Therefore, I think it would be wrong to say that Narcissus is uninterested in others, in society. And so one assumes that others will be also fascinated by one’s own worldly image. <i>‘The contemporary Narcissus, however, cannot be so certain of their own taste.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-14">[ 14 ]</a>
</p>
<p>
  <i>‘Today we are unable to like ourselves if we are not liked by the society in which we live.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-14">[ 14 ]</a> And in our society we have to become active if we want to be the objects of others’ admiration. Kathleen also declares that in order to achieve public admiration, one must practice Self-design and its demonstration.

<h2 class="title" id="voyerism">4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW VOYEURISM</h2>
<p6>Constant Online attention grows in a load of enduring structureless fragments, by carrying messages about ourselves to others, we become indispensable, self-centered, and egoistic.</p6>
<br/>
<p5>As a narcissistic society that is able to acknowledge quite a specific image of a unified whole, we are “forced” to take an interest in multi-media. In turn, it generates a universal narcissistic fascination with Voyeurism. <i>‘Voyeurism has traditionally meant the pleasure of secretly crossing the borders of a foreign territory, looking through a slit into the secret of another. However, in today’s Information era, Voyeurism is becoming an accepted universal standard.’</i>
  <a href="sources.html#source-16">[ 16 ]</a></p5>
<br/>
<p6>Voyeurism alleviates the weight of perception on the self, that brings us safe pleasure - we need to see but mainly to be seen, we find delight in online comparisons. <i>‘What is unique about digital narcissism is not the mechanism of narcissism itself, but a kind of megaphone effect with increased opportunities for pursuing narcissistic goals, if not also a competitive pressure to be seen and heard in a vast ocean of social media noise.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-17">[ 17 ]</a></p6>
<br/>
<p5>Thus the unknown has lost its delightful scent, its pheromones or musk. The unknown was completely revealed, the new Voyeurism set a new trend of known unknown. Vaclaj Hajek states in his essay Orgies of narcissism, self, super-face, visual self-righteous, <i>‘it is more interesting for us to focus on facts on self-reflection, self-esteem and self-presentation…The previously hidden unknown stands before us in its nudity and at the same time frightening, which no longer attracts or seduces us.’</i> <a href="sources.html#source-16">[ 16 ]</a></p5>
