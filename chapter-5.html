<h1 class="title">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TALKING AS <br/>A COMPULSIVE SIMULATION</h1>
<p><span>What does the acknowledgment <br/>of one’s Animus mean for social communication?</span></p>
</article>
<article>

<h2 class="title">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMPTINESS</h2>

<p>If we take into account the term Pleroma, the narcissism represents the fullness, then rationally the nihilism represents the nothingness, on the grounds that nihilist believes in nothing and that nothing can be known or communicated.</p>
<p>When one will get deprived of his Ego, talking suddenly seems like a compulsive simulation, ‘the amount of information will be eliminated due to the need to act only on the basis of primitivity.’ <a href="sources.html#source-18">[ 18 ]</a> Language is understood as a learned extension of communication, it is transmitted culturally, it is taught, corrected enlarged vocabulary.</p>
<p>The mind will be waiting for content that will be eventually filled in, and this creative perspective instils power in the emptiness. So forth everything that surrounds one at that moment, is just a reaction of the stated simulation. One has to be really good at authenticating oneself to accept his assertiveness and embrace the complete refusal. In the article ‘When will I be me? Why a sense of authenticity takes its time’,<a href="sources.html#source-19">[ 19 ]</a> written by Elizabeth Set argues that authenticity simply means embracing who you really are, at your very core, and acting in accordance with your own values and beliefs. In other words, authenticity is a subjective judgment.</p>
<p>Nothingness as a non-action, a symbol of non-being, ‘yet emptiness doesn’t mean “nothingness” or “energy-less… rather in many cases, the emptiness indicated a condition, which will likely be filled with content in the future.’ <a href="sources.html#source-20">[ 20 ]</a> To embrace emptiness, one has to leave an empty place in the center of the Self. ‘The mechanism of communication is activated when we look at an empty vessel’ <a href="sources.html#source-21">[ 21 ]</a>, ‘not as a negative state, but in terms of its capability to be filled with something.’ <a href="sources.html#source-20">[ 20 ]</a> Emptiness, the same as being deprived of one’s Ego does not merely imply the simplicity of one’s persona. ‘Rather, emptiness provides a space within which our imaginations can run free, vastly enriching our powers of perception and our mutual comprehension. Emptiness is this potential.’ <a href="sources.html#source-20">[ 20 ]</a></p>
</article>



<article>
<h2 class="title">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOCIETY DOOM</h2>
<p>When nothing is said, the communication stops being a meaningful linguistic exchange of some sort, yet there are times when words and content are unnecessary. In detail the successful communication does not start and end with a mere exchange of signs, thus when this exchanging process is performed simultaneously, an instant and mutual understanding occurs. Emptiness carries our thinking process forward.</p>
<p>The mental activities of one’s Animus do not begin at ground zero, rather, they are expressed as an unconscious impulse to survive, an emptiness that sets the brain to work and maintain the simple gut. ‘The fact that humankind has a history in the sense that animals do not is entirely the result
of language.’ <a href="sources.html#source-22">[ 22 ]</a></p>
<p>Immediately when we turn ourselves to the invisibility of our own subject, we become Self-sufficient in ourselves, when we overcome the paradoxical Self-objectification, we expose our inner sincere animus. This act then ceases to be Meaningless. One tries to get the ideal status of his hyper-real empty human Ego, entity. So the moment of lost Self is connected with the loss of memory, we are literally forced to give up our experiences and the mental image of our own past. Without talking, we would lead the society to its doom.</p>
